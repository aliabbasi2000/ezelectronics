# Informal description

EZElectronics (read EaSy Electronics) is a software application designed to help managers of electronics stores to manage their products and offer them to customers through a dedicated website. Managers can assess the available products, record new ones, and confirm purchases. Customers can see available products, add them to a cart and see the history of their past purchases.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name | Description |
| :--------------: | :---------: |
| Customer  |       Users of Application who purchase product      |
| Manager  |      Users of Application who sell product       |
| Start up Company  |    Developer of Software and Admins and CEO         |
| Product Company  |      The Company producing the Product       |
| Competitors  |       Competitor companies E.g. Ebay, Amazon retail, ...      |
| Payment Sevice ???  |       pay online / Pay by cash - E.g. paypal      |

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram

\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces

\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

|   Actor   | Logical Interface | Physical Interface |
| :-------: | :---------------: | :----------------: |
| Users: Customer, Manager |           Smartphone, PC        |       GUI(To be defined - key functions, show products and thier price, purchase a product, Sell a Product)             |
| Tech Admin |         PC          |           GUI(To be defined - all functions + manage accouns)         |
| Payment Service |       Internet Link           |       https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/             |
| Data Base |      SQL           |      Server              |





# Stories and personas

\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

|  ID   | Description |
| :---: | :---------: |
|  FR1: Manage Products  |     • FR1.0 Create a new Product / Delete a Product/ Delete all Products <br /> • FR1.1 Registers the arrival of Products with same model    <br /> • FR1.2 Mark a product as sold  <br /> • FR1.3 Retrieve a product (All / with the same Category / Model)  <br /> • FR1.4 Registers the arrival of a set of products <br /> • FR1.5 Mark a product as sold |
|  FR2: Manage Users  |   • FR2.0 Retrieves logged in user's Info.  <br /> • FR2.0 Retrieve a User (list of all users/ all users with a role / specific User with username)  <br /> •FR2.1 Create User / Delete User / Delete user with username / Delete all the users    |
|  FR3: Manage Cart  |      • FR3.0 Return the curent cart <br /> • FR3.1 Add / Remove a product to cart   <br /> • FR3.3  Returns the history of the paid carts of the User <br /> • FR3.4 Delete the cart of current user /Delete all carts |
